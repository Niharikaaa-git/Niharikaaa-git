# Hi there! 👋 I’m Niharika

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I’m currently a junior in college, passionate about building web applications and learning new things every day. If you enjoy sarcasm, clean design, and a dash of creativity, you’re in the right place.

## 🚀 Skills & Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**  
  React.js | HTML | CSS  
  I love designing user interfaces that don’t make people cry.

- **Backend (Learning):**  
  Node.js (Express soon, let’s hope I don’t break the internet)

## 🎨 Interests

- UI/UX Design & Web Development  
  Because good design is like good sarcasm—subtle, clever, and memorable.
- Graphic Design as a Hobby  
  I enjoy creating fun graphics and layouts on Canva (catch me making memes, logos, or portfolio pieces).
- Full-stack Development  
  Currently on a quest to become a backend wizard.

## 🛠️ Projects

Still cooking up my first repos. Stay tuned for projects that combine stunning visuals with solid code—maybe even a few sassy comments.

## 🤓 About Me

- College junior, caffeine enthusiast, and professional meme consumer.
- I write code and jokes with equal enthusiasm (quality may vary).
- Always up for learning something new or making things look pretty (and functional).
